# pythonProject
This is the beginning of my journey to do something with my life. 
This is what I wanted to do, and at least I am starting now. 
I know that this is not going to be easy, but I know that I can do it. 
All it takes is just a little bit of work a day.
I am not going to cheat my way through this. Hopefully. Some hints here and there are pretty fine.
